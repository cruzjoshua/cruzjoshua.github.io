# Overview
### Problem:
Hungry UH Students, especially new students, sometimes have no clue which food places near or on campus are suitable to their own liking.
### Solution:
This website is community-based and will be able to list all of the accessible food spots available for UH students specifically. Each food place will have its own picture and description about the restaurant or even food trucks. The description will also include a distance rating. Near the bottom of each page will show ratings and reviews from strictly only UH students. This will keep everyones' opinion UH-based.

# Mockup Page Ideas
  * Landing Page
  * List of Food Places
  * Admin List of Food Places
  * Food Places Description Page/Add Review & Rating
  * Sign in/Sign up Page
  * Profile Edit Page
  * Add Food Place
  * Delete Food Place
  * Edit Food Place
  * Delete/Edit Food Review

# Use Case Ideas
### Create UH student account:
User must be part of UH to sign up/in.
  Landing page → Sign in/Sign up Page → Profile Edit Page
### Users:
User appear on the landing page and navigates to the list of food places, rates the food place and leaves a comment.
  Landing page → Sign in/Sign up Page → List of Food Places → Food Places Description Page/Add Review & Rating
### Admins:
Admin keeps everything appropriate and settled. The reviews must be civil
Landing Page → Sign in/Sign up Page → Admin List of Food Places → Add/Delete/Edit Food Place → Delete/Edit Food Review

# Beyond the Basics
  * Filter food places with different tastes/keywords
  * Allow users to completely modify reviews and food places
  * Ban users using admin role
