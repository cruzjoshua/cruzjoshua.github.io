Design patterns are ways to create different possible of solutions to solving a specific problem. With the use of design patterns, software engineers can use this as a template to help their future complications.  Using design patterns to help solve your problems can help with readability. Having code that is understandable towards your own colleagues can help you succeed as a software engineer. So. utilizing design patterns and knowing which one to specifically use can help your accomplish tasks more efficiently. Four examples of design patterns are Factory, Singleton, Observer, and MVC patterns.

## Usage of Design Patterns
The use of design patterns depends on what kind of problem you have encountered. For an example, using factory design pattern can be used to restrict a local variable of a structure of different objects and allow you to make objects without knowing specifically what type you will need in previous code. For singleton design pattern, it is one of the simplest design patterns for modelling. Singleton pattern can be used in many ways and its design can be controversial in terms of time complexity usage. A singleton design pattern should only have one instance. It restricts a class to instantiate multiple objects. Singleton classes should also be globally accessible. This can be useful in situations where the main goal is to coordinate a specific action to a single result.
