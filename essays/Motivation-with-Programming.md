## ICS-314 Class Structure

As a computer engineer major, our class curriculum is a mixture with electrical engineering, and computer hardware classes with a portion of programming courses. Personally, I enrolled into the course with a mindset of just passing the course. After experiencing the first week of the class, I completely changed my mindset about the course and decided to actually learn the material and improve my profesional persona for the future. Within about two weeks of taking ICS-314, I absolutely enjoy the structure of this course. The athletic software engieering with practice WODs and in-class WODs is such a brilliant idea to help students prepare for the tech world in the future. As a student who dislikes being pressured with time, preparing for these WODs will definitely help every ICS-314 student for coding interviews.

## Motivation with Javascript

After completing the basics of Javascript with FreeCodeCamp, I have noticed the coding structure of Javascript is simple and straightforward. I have taken online courses about C, C++, and Java at another institution which made me realize that Javascript is the one for me. As a computer engineer, I always look for the shortest and most efficient way possible. With Javascript's simplicity and newbie-friendly environment, my motivation of becoming a programmer has sparked. There is something about this course that motivates me more than any other class. I think it has to do something with the class structure and how every detail of the professor's lecture will help the students in the long run. For me, I was never forced or built a public professional persona before. But with this class, it made me realize that these online tools are essential for my future, especially for a computer engineer.

## Importance of Time Management

Again, let's talk about the class structure. I appreciate how the course is organized. Since this is my first ICS course at University of Hawaii at Manoa, I do not know if all University of Hawaii at Manoa ICS courses are structured like this. Knowing the assignments description ahead of time via online vital for a student. With these resources available for me, I am able to manage my time wisely and more efficiently. With proper time managment, the quality of assignments will improve and while developing this has a habit, it will take account to the real world too. at the beginning of the semester, the workload is not too heavy and it is also reasonably spaced with its due dates. For the goals of this semester with ICS-314, I hope to become a better programmer, promote myself with an appealing professional persona for the future, and learn proper time management.
