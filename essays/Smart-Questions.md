## What is the Difference Between a Smart Question and a "Not-So-Smart" Question?

There is always that one student during lecture that constantly asks questions and you are wondering if they would ever stop. I personally appreciate these kinds of people because they provide interaction with the professor and allow the audience to acquire more material during lectures. However, there are students who ask “not-so-smart” questions who take up lecture time for both the professor and students. After reviewing Raymond's guidelines on how to ask questions the smart way, this made me realize that these skills do not only pertain to the software engineering field, but it can help with the real world and in school. As software engineers, learning how to properly manage your time and using available resources. Raymond’s paper is a great example on how to properly manage your time while being productive with your work. Asking simple questions will not make it easier for you or the helper on the forum you are posting on. 

How can we define what a smart question? A smart question must be informative, clear, and precise. You also must know what your problem is with whatever code you are having a bug with. Providing suggestions on how to solve your own problem is also a great way to make your question look more professional and serious. Most of the forum browsers are usually people who help others in need with their own free time. While doing these simple tasks, you may nonchalantly solve your own question before posting it on the forum. But if you do not solve it, that is still acceptable because the helpers would be able to identify your problem easily and know that you care with the way the question is posted.

What is a “not-so-smart” question? A “not-so-smart” question would be the complete opposite of a smart question. The original poster for the question would give little to no effort to assist the helpers answer the question. One example would be having a subject header that consist of “Please help me!” or a subject header with an irrelevant and lengthy title. Spelling and grammatical errors will also make the forum post unappealing to the community. Instead of asking straight forward questions like, “How do I complete this logic in C?”, describing your goal would allow the helper to analyze your problem more efficiently and provide a better answer in the end. There are many ways on how to describe a smart question and a “not-so-smart” question. The next section will provide smart question and “not-so-smart” question examples from StackOverflow, in my opinion.
