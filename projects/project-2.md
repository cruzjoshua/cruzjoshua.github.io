This is a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) project course at University of Hawaii at Manoa that consists of many different types of hands-on projects, such as space and aerial robotics, liquid-metal electronics, microrobotics, and many more! The specific project group I chose to collaborate with is the Droplet Generation group.

As I am new to this project, learning and exploring about the micro-world has always been an interest to me. Joining this project course will allow me to learn how to collab with other team members who specialize in other engineering majors and work effectively as a group. The goal of this project is to be able to design and implement a device that allows the usage to fabricate micro fluids. This will allow a seperate group of researches to effectively study the effect of diseases on the DNA of cells. The new set of goals of this project are to design a better microfluidic device with Arduino. As a student with Arduino experience, I am looking forward to help complete one of these goals!
