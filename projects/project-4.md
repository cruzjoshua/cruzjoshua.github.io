# What kind of project is this?
This project demonstrates the usage of the material used in my ICS-314 course. The learning outcomes of this project is to use an IDE effectively (IntelliJ IDEA), be competent with elementary JavaScript, use configuration management tools and techniques effectively, create high quality technical essays, efficiently create software, design and implement web pages using HTML and CSS, design using a Meteor framework, practicing working on a project team, and write useful project documentation.

# What is Ono Manoa Grindz?
Ono Manoa Grindz serves as the homepage for showcasing the vast variety of cuisines that is served here on the University of Hawaii - Manoa campus. With a quick visit to our page, you will be able to view all the food service vendors along with user-submitted ratings that we hope will serve useful. Our project is similar with Yelp as we used its idea for inspiration to help develop our application effectively.

# What is the purpose and how do we solve it?
There are many food choices on campus: campus center, food trucks, Manoa Gardens, Paradise Palms, vending machines, and so forth. Let’s say you have a desire for Chinese food today for lunch. What places on campus are serving Chinese food menu items today? Alternatively, let’s say that you love the fresh salmon fillet at Campus Center, but that dish is only served once every few weeks. How do you find out on the day that it’s available? Ono Manoa Grindz enables you to login on your device and determine what specific menu items will be available today at food locations in UH Manoa.
